<h3>
    Field of the Invention 
</h3>
<p>
The field of the invention is rod and coil construction systems. 
These are systems in which the basic structure of the rod and coil 
are combined to obtain distinct beneficial structural characteristics. 
</p>
<p>
Coil and Rod Construction is characterized by construction that utilizes the distinc characteristics 
of the coil to develop apparatus with unique qualities. 
</p>
<h3>
Distinct Apparatuses: 
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
1. Coil Joint 
<p>
A coil is used to connect two solid bodies. These joints have a full 
360-degree rotation. Coil Joints spring back to their original positions. Coil 
Joints can function in place of currently existing joints and will 
take its place alongside existing standard joints to be another 
standardly used type of joint in any number of applications. 
Along with the rotation, 
there is an extending and contracting motion as well. Restricted 
motion is achieved through various techniques. 
14 
</p>
</li>
<li>
2. Coil Body 
<p>
A coil is threaded through one or more rods while retaining its shape 
and reinforced by these rods. The threading of the coil can be 
adjusted to create bodies with various shapes. The Coil Body has 
distinct vibrational properties that enable shock absorption and or 
transfer. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
3. Coil Joint Spines 
<p>
A series of Coil Joints connected by rods form a strong and flexible 
structure. These Coil Joint Spines function as a kind of a strut for a 
given structure, providing support yet flexibility for the shape. 
Specific Qualities of these techniques are: 
<ul>
    <li>    
- High strength-to-weight ratio, 
</li>
<li>
High dimensional stability Coil Body 
</li>
<li>
Collapsible stretchable, and malleable Coil / Coil Spine bodies 
</li>
<li>
Hollow coil body 
</li>
<li>
Bias, the dampening and memory cffects of the construction result in 
a more lifelike motion and variable size. 
</li>
<li>
Full 360-degree rotation of Coil Joint 
</li>
<li>
Vibrational qualities for shock/vibration absorption and transfer 
Two applications of Rod and Coil construction are: 
</li>
<li>
Mechanical Hand 
</li>
<li>
Package 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Mechanical Hand 
</h3>
<p>
An embodiment of the present invention is as a mechanical hand. 
The Coil Joint functions as the human joint. The rod functions as the 
equivalent to human bone. The characteristics of the Coil Joints give 
the motion of the hand a realistic appearance. The dampening effect 
of the coils simulates the human bodies' dampening. Coil bias 
provides the mechanical hand with lifelike qualities of movement. 
Actuators and pulley systems can be attached to the rods to be used to 
move and control the hand. Coil Bodies form the shape of the hand 
itself with hollow bodies for transport or storage. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the Coil Joints' bias can be used as tendon 
tension. This enables finger action to be accomplished with a single 
'tendon' wire. 
Industry Usage of the Mechanical Hand 
Mechanical hands have application in industries in some of the 
following aspects: 
<ul>
    <li>
    safety in dangerous workplaces, meat packing 
    </li>
    <li>
    gripping capabilities better than traditional, handle delicate objects, 
    </li>
    <li>
    dampening qualities make it better suited to handle fragile objects. 
    </li>
    <li>

<p>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus of a mechanical hand based on rods 
and coils, that includes multiple parts comprising: one or more coil joints, a coil body, and one or 
more coil spines; wherein the coil joints function as the equivalent to human joints; there are rods 
that function as the equivalent to human bones; the coil joints create a dampening effect that 
simulates the dampening effect in human hands; there are coil bodies of the mechanical hand, 
that are used for transport and storage. 
</p>
<p>
The embodiment may be alternatively refined such that it further comprises: the fingers of the 
artificial hand can be replaced with tools that are of a similar size and not excessive weight. 
The embodiment may be alternatively refined such that it further comprises: the coil joints can 
be modified to simulate various human joints; where there is a bias in all coils and coil joints; the 
bias of the coil joints increases the ability of the artificial hand to grasp; the bias of the coil joint 
functions as tendon tension; the bias of all the coils results in more life-like motion; movement of 
the finger can be performed with a single wire opposing the bias of the coil. 
The embodiment may be alternatively refined such that it further comprises: the artificial hand 
can have autonomous motion by utilizing an actuator system. 
</p>
<p>
Having described the invention by the description and illustrations above, it should be 
understood that these are exemplary of the invention and are not to be considered as limiting. 
Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as limited by the foregoing description, but 
includes any equivalents.
