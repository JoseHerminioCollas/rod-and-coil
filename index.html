Coil and Rod Construction is characterized by construction that utilizes the characteristics 
of the rod and coil, combined, to obtain distinct beneficial structural characteristics
</p>
<h3>
    Elements of Rod and Coil Construction
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
1. Coil Joint 
<p>
A coil is used to connect two solid bodies. These joints have a full 
360-degree rotation. Coil Joints spring back to their original positions. Coil 
Joints can function in place of currently existing joints and will 
take its place alongside existing standard joints to be another 
standardly used type of joint in any number of applications. 
Along with the rotation, 
there is an extending and contracting motion as well. Restricted 
motion is achieved through various techniques. 
14 
</p>
</li>
<li>
2. Coil Body 
<p>
A coil is threaded through one or more rods while retaining its shape 
and reinforced by these rods. The threading of the coil can be 
adjusted to create bodies with various shapes. The Coil Body has 
distinct vibrational properties that enable shock absorption and or 
transfer. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
3. Coil Joint Spines 
<p>
A series of Coil Joints connected by rods form a strong and flexible 
structure. These Coil Joint Spines function as a kind of a strut for a 
given structure, providing support yet flexibility for the shape. 
Specific Qualities of these techniques are: 
<ul>
    <li>    
        High strength-to-weight ratio, 
    </li>
    <li>
        High dimensional stability Coil Body 
    </li>
    <li>
        Collapsible stretchable, and malleable Coil / Coil Spine bodies 
    </li>
    <li>
        Hollow coil body 
    </li>
    <li>
        Bias, the dampening and memory cffects of the construction result in a more lifelike motion and variable size. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Full 360-degree rotation of Coil Joint 
    </li>
    <li>
        Vibrational qualities for shock/vibration absorption and transfer 
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Mechanical Hand 
</h3>
<p>
An embodiment of the present invention is as a mechanical hand. 
The Coil Joint functions as the human joint. The rod functions as the 
equivalent to human bone. The characteristics of the Coil Joints give 
the motion of the hand a realistic appearance. The dampening effect 
of the coils simulates the human bodies' dampening. Coil bias 
provides the mechanical hand with lifelike qualities of movement. 
Actuators and pulley systems can be attached to the rods to be used to 
move and control the hand. Coil Bodies form the shape of the hand 
itself with hollow bodies for transport or storage. 
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the Coil Joints' bias can be used as tendon 
tension. This enables finger action to be accomplished with a single 
'tendon' wire. 
Industry Usage of the Mechanical Hand 
Mechanical hands have application in industries in some of the 
following aspects: 
<ul>
    <li>
    safety in dangerous workplaces, meat packing 
    </li>
    <li>
    gripping capabilities better than traditional, handle delicate objects, 
    </li>
    <li>
    dampening qualities make it better suited to handle fragile objects. 
    </li>
    <li>

provides strength without significant weight gain ideal for shipping. 
The package will demonstrate the usefulness of the hollow body, 
malleable shape, weight to strength ratio, Coil Joints' ability to 
cxpand and contract.

<h3>
A System of Construction
</h3>
<p>
Rod and Coil construction can be thought of as a method of construction that can produce a variety of distinct structures,
These structures would be characterized by one or more coil joints, coil bodies, and or coil spines. 
</p> 
<p>
The coil joint, which has 360 degree rotation, can be limited to simulate other types of joints.
This coil joint can be combined with other joint styles to create hybrid styles. 
The characteristics of the coil result in a more life-like motion. 
</p>
<p>
The coil body made with coil spines; 

wherein the compression action of the spring compresses over 
the contents within the package; wherein the package has a flexible shape due to the coil body made with coil spines;
wherein the flexible shape can be locked into place; wherein all coils have vibrational qualities.

Fig. 31 displays an artificial hand with rods and coil joints. This package differs from Fig. 30 
because it contains more details. 
Rod 3106 is thick and simulates the forearm of the hand. Horizontal rod 3017 simulates the 
wrist, and provides rotational capability as it rotates on Rod 3107. Five rods 3101 simulate 
fingers, while multiple coil joints 3102 simulate knuckles, in the sense that they can bend. 
Five rods 3105 represent thinner rods that move in tune with the movement of the fingers of the 
artificial hand. This is done by exerting pull on additional five thin rods 3104, which are 
connected to the five rods 3101 by loops 3103. As such, when pull is exerted on five rods 3105, 
then that pull is exerted on additional five thin rods 3104, which pulls loops 3103, which causes 
movement in five rods 3101 and multiple coil joints 3102. This series of movements thus 
simulates the movement of a hand with fingers and knuckles. It can be modified to focus on 1 or 
more fingers, as well as 1 or more knuckles, allowing for highly detailed and coordinated 
movement by the artificial hand.
